# Lungs Lesion Detection
This repository contains a deep learning project for detecting lung lesions in medical imaging, such as X-rays. The project leverages state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated analysis and diagnosis assistance.

Features
Lung Lesion Detection: Automatically identifies and highlights areas of concern in medical images.

Deep Learning Framework: Built using YOLOv8 model

Data Preprocessing: Includes various image processing techniques for medical image datasets.

Visualization: Generates bounding boxes for lesion localization with labels of various lesions.

Improvement scope: Method of implementing a multimodal data analysis for the same task is discussed.
